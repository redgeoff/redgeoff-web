Geoff Cox is the creator of [MSON](https://github.com/redgeoff/mson), a new declarative programming language that will serve as the foundation of a UI that will allow anyone to make software. He loves taking on ambitious, yet wife-maddening, projects like [creating a database](https://github.com/delta-db/deltadb) and [distributed data syncing system](https://github.com/redgeoff/spiegel). You can reach him at [github.com/redgeoff](https://github.com/redgeoff) or [@CoxGeoffrey](https://twitter.com/coxgeoffrey).
